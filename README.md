# KISSAN_CONNECT 

Kissan_Connect is a project aimed at connecting farmers directly with Retailers, cutting out intermediaries and ensuring fair prices for both parties.

Our moto itself is Streamlining the agricultural delivery Pipeline with advanced technology and modern practices.

Our team, TOP_G, has been working tirelessly on this project, developing an app and website that makes it easy for farmers to sell their produce and for Retailers to buy fresh, locally-sourced food. We believe that Kissan_Connect has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about food supply chains, and we're excited to see it come to live action.


# PROBLEM FETCHED

Farmers faces challenges such as uncertain income, delayed payments, limited access to business information, production wastage and inefficient distribution system.

The conventional supply chain suffers from lack of organisation, significant amount of food wastage and is highly inefficient.

# IMPLEMENTATION

1. Google Firebase : Manage user authentication, real-time database, cloud storage
2. Google TensorFlow : M/L model to Predict accurate “Suggestive Pricing” of each food product according to
region, season, quality, etc
3. React Native: Used to build our cross-platform mobile application that works on both iOS and Android
devices
4. ReactJS: Used to build the frontend of our Executive dashboard for inventory management and bidding
operations
5. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): FCM is used to send push notifications to users about new inventory,
biddings, enlisting approvals and other events in the application
6. Google Pay: Used to facilitate transactions between retailers and customers
7. Google App Engine: Used to host and scale our application backend.
