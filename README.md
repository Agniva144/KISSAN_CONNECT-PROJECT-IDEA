# KISSAN_CONNECT 
Kissan_Connect is a project aimed at connecting farmers directly with Retailers, cutting out intermediaries and ensuring fair prices for both parties.

Our moto itself is Streamlining the agricultural delivery Pipeline with advanced technology and modern practices.

Our team, TOP_G, has been working tirelessly on this project, developing an app and website that makes it easy for farmers to sell their produce and for Retailers to buy fresh, locally-sourced food. We believe that Kissan_Connect has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about food supply chains, and we're excited to see it come to live action.
